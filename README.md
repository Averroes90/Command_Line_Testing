Based on your detailed description of the AI chat app and the requirement to add 'markdown-it' as a plugin and revise the highlight.js implementation to integrate well with markdown, here are 10 self-contained instructions for 10 separate AI chat instances. Each step details the background and what needs to be accomplished in order to make the integration seamless. 1. **Markdown-it Plugin Integration: Setup** - Background: Integrate 'markdown-it' into the AI chat app Vue project as a plugin. - Task: Create the basic setup and registration of the 'markdown-it' plugin in the Vue application. Ensure the plugin is configurable and allows for markdown parsing in the components. - Deliverable: A Vue plugin file with 'markdown-it' setup, registration code, and base configuration. 2. **Highlight.js Plugin Creation: Setup** - Background: Convert the existing highlight.js code block highlighting into a Vue plugin. - Task: Create a new Vue plugin for highlight.js that encapsulates the highlighting functionality currently handled in the AI message component. - Deliverable: A Vue plugin file with the initial highlight.js setup and configuration. 3. **Plugin Configuration - Markdown** - Background: The app currently displays responses and highlights code. It now requires markdown rendering. - Task: Configure the 'markdown-it' plugin to integrate with the app's existing message rendering flow in a way that maintains existing features while adding markdown support. - Deliverable: Updated configuration scripts for 'markdown-it' that describe how markdown rendering should work within the Vue app. 4. **Plugin Configuration - highlight.js** - Background: Update code block highlighting to be compatible with markdown rendering. - Task: Adjust the highlight.js plugin configuration to work in tandem with markdown-it, ensuring code blocks are properly detected and highlighted inside markdown-rendered content. - Deliverable: Updated configuration scripts for the highlight.js plugin. 5. **Store Module Update for Markdown Processing** - Background: The Vuex store manages AI chats and needs to incorporate markdown processing. - Task: Modify the `sendPrompt` action and `mapApiResponseToInteraction` utility to process markdown in the AI response using the markdown-it plugin before adding the interaction to the state. - Deliverable: Updates Vuex store module with amendments to handle markdown conversion. 6. **ClassifyResponse Function Refactor** - Background: Responses are classified by types, such as 'code' and 'text'. Markdown introduces more types. - Task: Refactor the `classifyResponse` function to account for markdown elements, ensuring each markdown element type is classified properly for later rendering. - Deliverable: An updated `classifyResponse` function that can classify markdown elements. 7. **AI Message Component: Markdown Integration** - Background: The AI message component currently helps to format and display messages with highlighted code blocks. - Task: Amend the AI message component to utilize the markdown-it plugin, ensuring markdown formatting is rendered and existing functionality is preserved. - Deliverable: The updated AI message component with markdown rendering. 8. **AI Message Component: Code Highlight Post-Markdown** - Background: After markdown is rendered, code blocks need highlighting. - Task: Update the AI message component to call the highlight.js plugin after the markdown has been rendered to highlight code blocks within the markdown content. - Deliverable: AI message component incorporating post-markdown code block highlighting. 9. **User Interface Styling Adjustments** - Background: With markdown, the visual presentation may change. - Task: Review and adjust the styling of markdown content in the chat window to ensure a professional look that integrates well with the app's design. - Deliverable: CSS/Styling updates for displaying markdown content. 10. **End-to-End Functionality Review** - Background: Changes have been made to the chat window components. - Task: Review the whole flow from receiving AI completions to displaying formatted markdown in the chat window, ensuring all components correctly interact to display a markdown formatted response. - Deliverable: A report on the end-to-end functionality test including flowchart or sequence diagrams. These steps are issued to ensure a methodical integration of markdown rendering into the AI chat application, paying attention to professional standards and a seamless user experience. Each AI instance can ask for clarifications as needed.
